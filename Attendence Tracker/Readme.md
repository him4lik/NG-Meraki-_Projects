## Attendence Tracker

Create a program with two functionalities:
#### 1. Let students mark their attendence.
   Ask for student name then ask whether he/she wants to mark his/her attendence or not.
#### 2. Check today's attendence for a student.
   Ask for student name - If student name not present then print 'student_name is absent today' else print 'student_name is present  today'. 

        Input 1:
        Enter 1 to mark attendence and enter 2 to check attendence of a student: 1
        Please enter your name: student_name
        Enter Y to mark attendence and N to end program without marking: Y
