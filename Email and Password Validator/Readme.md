## Email and Password Validator

Check whether entered email is in the format  `xxx@xxx.xxx` or not and check whether entered password contains:
atleast one number
atleast one uppercase character
atleast one lowercase character
atleast one special character from ['_','@','$']

If email is not validated, don't ask for password input and print 'Please enter email in the format `xxx@xxx.xxx`'. If password if not validated then print 'Password not Validated'. If both email and password is in correct format then print 'Email and pasword are validated.'
